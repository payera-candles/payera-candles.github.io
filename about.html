<main class="container"><h2>Different Types of Waxes</h2><p>Currently we use a vareity of waxes to making candle - the very popular ones are Paraffin and Soy, but there are other options like Palm, Coconut, Beeswax and Specialty Plant Waxes (e.g., Carnauba, Candelilla, Japan wax) </p> 
<p>Let's understand why we use each of them to make our candles</p>
<li>Paraffin is the cheapest wax available, hence it is used by a large number of retailers, but this produces a whole lot of toxins as it is made of petroleum </li>
<li>Soy wax is made out of Soybean oil, less harmful for the environment, it costs a bit more than paraffin wax </li>
<li>Coconut wax is extremely eco-friendly as it is the most natural wax form, but it is too expensive (due to its low supply) to use as a raw material for a candle maker</li>
