    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Payera was born from a love of nature, calm spaces, and intentional living. Each candle is hand-poured in small batches using sustainable soy wax, pure cotton wicks, and fragrance blends inspired by the world around us.</p>
    <p>We believe in creating warmth, balance, and serenity through scent — while being kind to the planet and your home.</p>

      <h2>Why We Choose These Materials — Quality, Safety & Sustainability</h2>
      <p>At Payera, every element of our candles is chosen thoughtfully. We want you to enjoy beautiful, long-lasting light without compromise. Here's a closer look at what goes into each jar:</p>

      <h3>Sustainable Soy Wax</h3>
      <p>We use 100% natural soy wax, derived from renewable soybeans. Compared to traditional paraffin (a petroleum byproduct), soy wax offers several advantages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cleaner burn</strong> — Produces minimal soot when properly wicked and trimmed, helping keep your walls and ceilings cleaner.</li>
        <li><strong>Longer-lasting</strong> — Soy wax has a lower melting point, so it burns slower and more evenly — often 30-50% longer than paraffin candles of the same size.</li>
        <li><strong>Eco-friendly</strong> — Biodegradable, renewable, and supports agriculture (especially when sourced responsibly).</li>
        <li><strong>Excellent scent throw</strong> — Holds fragrance oils beautifully for a strong yet natural aroma experience.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Note:</em> Reputable sources like the National Candle Association confirm that all major candle waxes (soy, paraffin, beeswax, etc.) can burn cleanly and safely when made properly — the key is quality ingredients and proper care.</p>

      <h3>Pure Cotton Wicks</h3>
      <p>We only use 100% natural cotton wicks (lead-free and zinc-free) because safety and clean burning are non-negotiable.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Even, stable flame</strong> — Reduces mushrooming and excessive flickering.</li>
        <li><strong>Minimal soot & smoke</strong> — Especially important for indoor air quality.</li>
        <li><strong>Safer</strong> — No harmful heavy metals or synthetic cores that were once common in cheaper wicks.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Responsible Burning & Fire Safety</h3>
      <p>We love candles, but safety comes first. Follow these simple guidelines from experts like the National Candle Association:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Always trim the wick to ¼ inch (6mm) before lighting — prevents high flames and soot.</li>
        <li>Never leave a burning candle unattended.</li>
        <li>Keep candles at least 12 inches (30 cm) away from anything flammable (curtains, books, bedding).</li>
        <li>Place on a stable, heat-resistant surface, out of reach of children and pets.</li>
        <li>Avoid drafts — they cause uneven burning and smoking.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With proper care, your Payera candle will bring joy and calm — safely.</p>
